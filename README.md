# Mizuxe 
## A one page website built to advertise a motivational book
----
Mizuxe was built using:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap 4
- Sass

This site is fully responsive to mobile.

The build consisted of downloading bootstrap files instead of using the CDN allowing me to edit the files directly. This meant I changed the color of the "primary" class along with some of the margin sizes.

This project was made with the help of a course by Brad Traversy.
